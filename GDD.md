## Introduction
### Pitch
A top-down GTA 1 style zombie survival game with a sound-based AI and limited vision at night. Players must navigate a generated world, loot for resources, and fight off zombies to reach a safe zone X km/miles away.
### Game Summary
### Player Experience
The player will travel through a procedurally generated city, towards the safe zone! They'll loot for weapons, and food to help deal with the zombies that target anything that makes a noise. The player can travel on foot, or by car - but, they must keep an eye on their fuel gauge. As night falls they must make use of car headlights, street lights, or a flash light to able to see any zombies sneaking up on them.

### Inventory
* Health regeneration through food! Maybe you'll find some beans in an old building.
* Inventory is shape space limited. E.g. a baseball bat takes 3 squares of space vs your Tamagotchi which takes 1 square.
### Cars
* Cars, to move to the safe zone quicker, you can use cars; but watch out most of them are broken down. You'll need to get fuel from them for your own car, you can also use your car as additional inventory.
### Zombies
* Zombies react to noise, moving towards your position when you make noise.
### Day/Night
* Day/Night cycle: At night as visibility decreases, making it important to use a flashlight or make less noise as a zombie could creep up on you without knowing
