## Pitch
A top-down(Stardew Valley camera angle), 2D zombie survival game with a sound-based AI and limited vision at night. Players must navigate a generated world, loot for resources, and fight off zombies to reach a safe zone X km/miles away.

Mechanics:
* Cars, to move to the safe zone quicker, you can use cars; but watch out most of them are broken down. You'll need to get fuel from them for your own car, you can also use your car as additional inventory.
* Zombies react to noise, moving towards you when you make noises.
* Day/Night cycle: At night as visibility decreases, making it important to use a flashlight or make less noise as a zombie could creep up on you without knowing
* Stretch Goal: weather like rain, during the day to keep the tension
* World generation: Based on roads, predefined buildings will spawn that contain random items that you can loot!
* Stretch Goal: As you move out of the city, it becomes less dense with buildings
* Health regeneration through food! Maybe you'll find some beans in an old building.
* Inventory is shape space limited. E.g. a baseball bat takes 3 squares of space vs your Tamagotchi which takes 1 square
