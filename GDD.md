## Pitch
A top-down GTA 1 style zombie survival game with a sound-based AI and limited vision at night. Players must navigate a generated world, loot for resources, and fight off zombies to reach a safe zone X km/miles away.

**Mechanics**:
* Cars, to move to the safe zone quicker, you can use cars; but watch out most of them are broken down. You'll need to get fuel from them for your own car, you can also use your car as additional inventory.
* Zombies react to noise, moving towards your position when you make noise.
* Day/Night cycle: At night as visibility decreases, making it important to use a flashlight or make less noise as a zombie could creep up on you without knowing
* World generation: Based on roads, predefined buildings will spawn that contain random items that you can loot!
* 3D buildings with a blocky aesthetic, creating a distinctive atmosphere.
* Health regeneration through food! Maybe you'll find some beans in an old building.
* Inventory is shape space limited. E.g. a baseball bat takes 3 squares of space vs your Tamagotchi which takes 1 square.
* (Depending on the theme/scope) Multiplayer, a group of survivers work together to get to the safe zone.
